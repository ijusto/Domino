# Domino

## Rules
* Player vs "Computer"
* Number of tiles: 28
* 7 tiles for player
* 14 tiles are in the side face down, for players to use when they don't have anything they can play
* The computer is the first one to play, always with the 6-6 tile (this tile is the only one determined by the rules).
* The overall objective is to be the first without tiles or with the least amount when it isn't possible to continue playing. Otherwise, there will be a tie.
