# Domino

## Rules
* Player vs "Computer"
* Number of tiles: 28
* 7 tiles per player
* 14 tiles are available for players to get when they don't have anything they can play. If they require one of them, the turn is passed to the other player.
* The computer is the first one to play, always with the 6-6 tile (this tile is the only one determined by the rules).
* Tiles can only be played when they turn green.
* The overall objective is to be the first without tiles or with the least amount when it isn't possible to continue playing. Otherwise, there will be a tie.
